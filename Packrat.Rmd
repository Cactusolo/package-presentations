## Why Use Packrat?


![Packrat](http://photos.happyherbivore.com/2013/08/packrat111208.gif)




- Isolation
- Portability
- Reproducibility



- Have you ever had to use trial-and-error to figure out what R packages you need to install to make someone else’s code work and then been left with those packages globally installed forever???

- Have you ever updated a package to get code in one of your projects to work, only to find that the updated package makes code in another project stop working???


========================================================

## How it works

- Packrat stores your package dependencies inside your project directory
rather than in your personal R library
- This directory is known as your **private library**
- When you start an R session in a packrat project directory, R will only
look for packages in your private library
- if you install or remove a package, those changes are only made to your
private library



### **Restoring:** the process of istalling packages to private libraries from a snapshot


- Private libraries don't usually travel well since the contents are compiled for your specific computer, OS, and R version
- Packrat takes a **snapshot** of your private library, which it saves to your project directory
- From this, Packrat can re-create the same private library on another computer


Installing Packrat
========================================================

![packrat](http://www.newswise.com/images/uploads/2009/04/03/fullsize/woodrat2juniper.jpg)



> install.packages("packrat")

Set-up
========================================================

set up the project directory to use Packrat

> packrat::init:

- do this first thing before typing any other code
- include a path after init if you are not in your working directory  
  + ex. packrat::init("~/projects/pollinatordata")
  

If you have R-studio (v. 0.98.945 or newer), you can simply check the box!

## Congratulations!  You have achieved isolation

-----------

- You’re no longer in an ordinary R project; you’re in a Packrat project. 
- You now have your own private package library
- Any packages you install from inside a packrat project are only available to that project
- Any packages you install outside of the project are not available to the project

What is a library?
=============================


![library](https://yearlongphotos.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/october-17-2012-boise-library.jpg?w=1254&h=836)

to see what's in your library

> library()

library = directory where packages are stored

Packrat makes a private library for you and helps you to keep it clean and organized



Installing Packages in your Private Library
========================================================

> install.packages("reshape2")

> install.packages("stringr")

> install.packages("ggplot2")

- install a package the way you normally would

Taking a Snapshot of your Private Library
========================================================

![snapshot](http://pbskids.org/curiousgeorge/games/img/g_icon_snapshot_ovr.gif)

> packrat::snapshot()


Restoring Snapshots
======================================================== 
### If you want to run your project on a different computer
- After copying a project to a new computer, simply launch R from your project directory
- Packrat automates the whole process
- All of the packages in the snapshot will be installed in your project’s private package library.

Check Status
========================================================
> packrat::status()

Restoring Snapshots
========================================================
If you delete a package that you realize later you need or if a collaborator makes a change to a snapshot

> packrat::restore()

Cleaning Up
========================================================
- Packrat analyzes your code to determine if there are packages that were maybe needed at one time but are no
longer used
- You can then tell Packrat to remove these functions

- check the status
> packrat::status()

- Packrat will tell you which packages are installed but not needed
- Remove these unneeded packages
> packrat::clean()

Demonstration 
========================================================
Now we will go through a brief interactive demonstration with Packrat

**Install Packrat**

> install.packages("packrat")

**Put Packrat in your Library**

>library(packrat)


**Install a few packages for this demonstration**

> install.packages("reshape2")

> install.packages("stringr")
> install.packages("ggplot2")

**Take a snapshot of your current private library**

> packrat::snapshot() 

**Check the status of your private library**

> packrat::status()

all should be up-to-date

**Remove a Package**

> remove.packages("reshape2")

**Check status again**

> packrat::status()

Packrat should now tell you that there was a package removed

**You can then bring back the removed package**

> packrat::restore()

**Re-check the status**

> packrat::status()

**To get rid of packages you are no longer using**

> packrat::clean()

**To bring those packages back**

> packrat::restore()
